  <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

  <h4>What is a sustaining member?</h4>
  <p>When you're a sustaining member, it simply means that your donation recurs automatically on a monthly or yearly basis via credit card. This provides the Tribune with the sort of predictable revenue that allows us to plan budgets a few years at a time, and it helps eliminate renewal mailings or lapses in your membership.</p>

  <h4>Why should I become a member of The Texas Tribune?</h4>

As a member, your contributions go directly to supporting this mission by helping make our content free and accessible to all Texans.</p>
